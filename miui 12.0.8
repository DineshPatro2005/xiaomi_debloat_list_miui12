*MIUI Debloat List*
I used Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools (available from the developer here), but this can be preformed via adb also.

Turn on USB Debugging
- In cmd type adb devices, and allow adb authorization on device
- If using Xiaomi ADB/Fastboot Tools do not use the uninstall mode, it has caused a bootloop for me, Im not sure what package yet.
- WARNING If rooted and using the adb method do not use the ADB shell in SU mode, since MIUI 11 any app removed via root will cause a bootloop.
- Reboot & Enjoy

So far i have managed to disable all packages below without issue, this list isn't extensive yet I am still testing and will edit the post in time.

*Removing MI Share will remove Mi Share from the settings menu
**Removing MI Wallpaper will make it a pain in the ass to change your wallpaper, best to leave this one alone.
